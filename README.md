Shiny app dashboard to follow my sport trainings

After 10 years running I decided to create my own training dashboard. It has been an interesting job where I had the opportunity to play with R, shiny, java, json and strava platform.

It gathers info from Strava and then paint the graphs and tables in a shiny App.

It is curious to see some metrics as:

* Fastest day of the week: Friday.
* Time more frequent to run: 18.00
* Check if I have better results in summer months or in winter months ðŸ˜‰
The dashboard is here:
